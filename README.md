This repository contains solutions for Node.js labs.

## Lab 1
Lab 1 is a basic HTTP server that performs arithmetic operations based on the URL path. It parses the request URL to extract the operation and numbers, calculates the result, and writes it to a file. The server listens on port 3000.

---

## Lab 2
Lab 2 involves creating an event module with `on` and `emit` functions, as well as creating a module for flight ticket reservation.

### Task 1
The flight ticket module contains information about the seat number, flight number, departure and arrival airports, and traveling date.

### Task 2
Users can display, get, and update the information of their ticket.

### Bonus
Create your own module that can be used in flight tickets reservation.

## Lab 3
Lab 3 is similar to Lab 2 but uses Express.js. It also includes an HTTP server that handles both GET and POST requests from the client.

- The server listens on port 7001 for Task 1.
- The server listens on port 7002 for Task 2.
